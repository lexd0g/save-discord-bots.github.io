# Why Discord should not make the upcoming API changes that will block bots from being able to read message content.

**What Discord is doing:**  
Discord is aiming to stop verified bots from being able to read message content, forcing bot developers to move to slash commands for interaction.
<br />
<br />
**Why Discord is doing it:**  
They claim it's for security, as it would stop malicious bots being able to read message content, requiring you to have to apply to get the intents to read message content.
In reality, this doesn't help at all, since 99% of malicious data collecting data are bots running on regular user accounts, as opposed to bot accounts, which are the ones being restricted under these new changes.
<br />
<br />
**What this will affect:**  
This interferes with auto-moderation systems that prevent the very platform from being abused by malicious people (e.g. raids, hateful messages); it also breaks effectively every single public bot. Discord is requiring bot developers to rewrite their bots to adapt to slash commands, having to put a lot of time into this, for no clear benefits. Additionally, the "privacy/security" claims don't exactly make sense, due to self-bots still existing in the first place, and self-bots being the main cause of the message content/tracking issues.
<br />
<br />
**What we can do:**  
We're opening this website to hopefully inform people of the changes Discord is introducing to their API, and why bots are important to Discord.

# Here's what you can do to help this movement:
**Are you a Discord user?**   
Share this website on social media, in Discord servers or any other place you see fit.

**Are you a server owner?**  
If you rely on bots, please consider sharing this website in your server's announcements channel, along with a message clarifying how this affects Discord guilds.
<br />
<br />
**Are you a bot developer?**  
Consider including a message in your bots, linking this website. A good place for this would be the help command, or embeds. Here's an example of a message included in a Sonnet instance.
<br />
<br />
**Are you a Discord employee?**  
Please take our feedback. This is going to break how many servers work and will probably end up driving away members and revenue from Discord as a platform.
